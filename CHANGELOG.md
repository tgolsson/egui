# Egui Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## Unreleased

### Added ‚≠ê

* Wrapping layouts:
  * `ui.horizontal_wrapped(|ui| ...)`: Add widgets on a row but wrap at `max_size`.
  * `ui.horizontal_wrapped_for_text`: Like `horizontal_wrapped`, but with spacing made for embedding text.
* `egui::Layout` now supports justified layouts where contents is _also_ centered, right-aligned, etc.
* `ui.allocate_ui(size, |ui| ...)`: Easily created a sized child-`Ui`.
* `SelectableLabel` (`ui.selectable_label` and `ui.selectable_value`): A text-button that can be selected.
* `ui.small_button`: A smaller button that looks good embedded in text.

### Changed üîß

* Changed default font to [Ubuntu-Light](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu).
* Refactored `egui::Layout` substantially, changing its interface.

## 0.4.0 - 2020-11-28

### Added ‚≠ê

* `TextEdit` improvements:
  * Much improved text editing, with better navigation and selection.
  * Move focus between `TextEdit` widgets with tab and shift-tab.
  * Undo edtis in a `TextEdit`.
  * You can now check if a `TextEdit` lost keyboard focus with `response.lost_kb_focus`.
  * Added `ui.text_edit_singleline` and `ui.text_edit_multiline`.
* You can now debug why your `Ui` is unexpectedly wide with `ui.style_mut().visuals.debug_expand_width = true;`

### Changed üîß

* Pressing enter in a single-line `TextEdit` will now surrender keyboard focus for it.
* You must now be explicit when creating a `TextEdit` if you want it to be singeline or multiline.
* Improved automatic `Id` generation, making `Id` clashes less likely.
* Egui now requires modifier key state from the integration
* Added, renamed and removed some keys in the `Key` enum.
* Fixed incorrect text wrapping width on radio buttons

### Fixed üêõ

* Fixed bug where a lost widget could still retain keyboard focus.

## 0.3.0 - 2020-11-07

### Added ‚≠ê

* Panels: you can now create panels using `SidePanel`, `TopPanel` and `CentralPanel`.
* You can now override the default Egui fonts.
* Add ability to override text color with `visuals.override_text_color`.
* The demo now includes a simple drag-and-drop example.
* The demo app now has a slider to scale all of Egui.

### Changed üîß

* `ui.horizontal(...)` etc returns `Response`.
* Refactored the interface for `egui::app::App`.
* Windows are now constrained to the screen.
* `Context::begin_frame()` no longer returns a `Ui`. Instead put your widgets into a `SidePanel`, `TopPanel`, `CentralPanel`, `Window` or `Area`.
* `Context::end_frame()` now returns paint commands that need to be converted to triangles with `Context::tesselate()`.
* Anti-aliasing is now off by default in debug builds.

### Removed üî•

* You can no longer throw windows.

### Fixed üêõ

* Fix a bug where some regions would slowly grow for non-integral scales (`pixels_per_point`).

## 0.2.0 - 2020-10-10

* Color picker
* Unicode characters in labels (limited by [what the default font supports](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comfortaa#glyphs))
* Simple drop-down combo box menu
* Logarithmic sliders
* Optimization: coarse culling in the tesselator
* CHANGED: switch argument order of `ui.checkbox` and `ui.radio`

## 0.1.4 - 2020-09-08

This is when I started the CHANGELOG.md, after almost two years of development. Better late than never.

* Widgets: label, text button, hyperlink, checkbox, radio button, slider, draggable value, text editing
* Layouts: horizontal, vertical, columns
* Text input: very basic, multiline, copy/paste
* Windows: move, resize, name, minimize and close. Automatically sized and positioned.
* Regions: resizing, vertical scrolling, collapsing headers (sections)
* Rendering: Anti-aliased rendering of lines, circles, text and convex polygons.
* Tooltips on hover
